term: Class Saliency Map
definition: >
  A class saliency map is a visualization used to debug image classifiers. Given an input
  image and a class, the map shows, for each pixel in the input image, how much does that pixel
  contribute to the final class score. The class saliency map is computed by taking the gradient
  of the the class score relative to the pixel values of the input image.
